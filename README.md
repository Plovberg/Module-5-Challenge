Notes:
I could not get the number of unique mice to match 248-the quantity show in the starter code.  

There is a strong correlation between tumor size and mouse weight, evidenced by the last chart, and a p-stat close to zero, which would reject the null hypothesis Ho: “There is no significant relationship between tumor size, and the subjects weight”.  
Capomulin seems promising as a drug regimen to reduce tumors, evidenced by the tumor’s reduction in volume over time in the study.
